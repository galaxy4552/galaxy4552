## 🔍 Research

### OwlResearch (Whitepaper / Core Theory)
https://github.com/galaxy4552/OwlResearch/

Focus:
- Field-based cognition
- Non-ranking / non-generation spaces
- Semantic structure beyond tokenization
- Failure regions & hallucination geometry

https://github.com/galaxy4552/Pipowl/

Focus:
- Semantic embedding architectures
- Meaning-space modeling
- Representation stability

---

### SOE_IME_OPEN (Decode-focused Language System)
https://github.com/galaxy4552/SOE_IME_OPEN/

Focus:
- Decode-oriented language behavior
- Lexical + semantic fusion
- Minimal, interpretable decision pipelines
